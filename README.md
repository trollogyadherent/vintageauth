# VintageAuth
Vintage Story auth mod for offline servers. Early alpha phase, expect shit to break.

Nothing has been tested on Windows.
For now, all players are set into survival mode after login.

Current features:
* Blocking players at spawn until they log in or get kicked after a configurable amount of time
* Possibility to disable/enable the creation of accounts in the config
* Possibility to restrict account creation to single use tokens, generated by any allowed role
* If installed on the client, the mod saves valid credentials and auto-logins next time a cached server is joined

The config is in `VintagestoryData/ModConfig/vintageauth.json`. By default, the server database is located in `VintagestoryData/vintageauth_db.db`.

Things of note:
* A configurable administrator account is always generated if missing at server startup, available in the config. The password is randomly generated to prevent funny default password incidents.
* Passwords are le salted and le hashed in a sqlite db. Note to players: for validation, the server sees them anyways, so you should
assume your serverop knows your password. Modifying this mod to log your credentials, IP, whatever is TRIVIAL.

Commands (<mandatory>, [optional]):
* `vahelp` help command. You can use `vahelp command` to get more details.
* `register <password>`
* `login <password>`
* `delaccount <password>`
* `changepw <oldpw> <newpw>`
* `logout`
* `gentoken`
* `deactivate`
* `reactivate`
* `vaban`
* `changerole`

### Building
* Use `buildmod.sh`. Can't be bothered to add a script for Winbloat. Just import into vscode, hit run and it should spit out a dll.
